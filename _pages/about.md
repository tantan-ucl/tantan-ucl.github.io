Tan Tan holds a research position at Delft University of Technolog (TU Delft) and thw Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Digital Fabrication. He has an interdisciplinary background in architectural design, project management and sustainable construction. He studied for his PhD and MSc from the Bartlett, UCL's faculty of the built environment. He obtained his BArch from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Before his PhD, He worked at the Department of Real Estate and Construction of the University of Hong Kong as a research assistant.

His current research focuses on exploring implementation barriers and new project delivery methods of digital fabrication in the Swiss construction industry. He is interested in improving sustainability in complex buildings, e.g., health care, through integrated design management and engineering, e.g., DfMA & digital fabrication.
