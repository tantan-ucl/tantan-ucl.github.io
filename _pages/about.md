Dr. Tan Tan is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Real Estate and Construction, Faculty of Architecture, the University of Hong Kong (HKU), and a Principal Investigator at the National Centre of Technology Innovation for Digital Construction in Hong Kong (NCTI-DC-HK) member. Previously, he held postdoctoral positions at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands and the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Digital Fabrication in Switzerland. Dr. Tan received his PhD in Architecture and MSc in Project and Enterprise Management from University College London (UCL Bartlett) and his BArch from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).

His research intersects architecture, technology, and business, aiming to bridge architectural design and construction management through pioneering Design for X (DfX) methodologies for industrialized construction and sustainable development. His primary research interests are: 
* **Design Engineering Informatics** (DfMA, DfS, computational design generation, automated design review) 
* **Design Management Innovation** (digital transformation including GenAI, digital fabrication, VR/AR, BIM, and modular design theory).

Dr. Tan's achievements include receiving the ESI Highly Cited Paper Award, Editor's Choice Paper Award, and Best Paper Awards, alongside various prestigious scholarships such as the UK Full PhD Scholarship, UK Grand Challenges Doctoral Grant, and China National Award for Outstanding Self-funded Students Abroad. He currently serves as a Corresponding Expert for the Chinese Academy of Engineering journal "Frontiers of Engineering Management," Young Editorial Board Member for "Journal of Engineering Management" and "Smart Construction," and as Co-Chair for CAAD Futures 2025. Since founding his research group in 2024, he has actively supported his team members in securing various academic honors, including Hong Kong government scholarships and outstanding thesis awards.

谭坦博士，香港大学建筑学院房地产与建设系助理教授、中国国家数字建造技术创新中心香港分中心（NCTI-DC-HK）研究组负责人（PI）。曾任荷兰代尔夫特理工大学（TU Delft）和瑞士国家数字制造能力研究中心（NCCR Digital Fabrication）博士后研究员。博士、硕士毕业于英国伦敦大学学院（UCL Bartlett）建筑学与工程管理方向，本科毕业于华中科技大学建筑学系。

谭坦博士的研究横跨建筑、技术与商业领域，致力于结合设计工程与管理创新，推动建筑工业化中的设计方法（Design for X，DfX），实现设计与建造管理的融合和可持续发展。其研究主要包括两个方向：

* **设计工程信息学**（如面向制造与装配设计DfMA、安全设计DfS、计算生成设计和自动化设计审查等）
* **设计管理创新**（如数字化转型、生成式人工智能GenAI、数字建造、VR/AR、BIM和模块化设计理论等）

谭坦博士曾获ESI高被引论文奖、主编精选论文奖、最佳论文奖等多个学术荣誉，以及英国全额博士奖学金、英国重大挑战博士基金、中国国家优秀自费留学生奖学金等科研资助。目前担任中国工程院院刊《Frontiers of Engineering Management》特约通讯专家、《工程管理学报》与《Smart Construction》青年编委，并担任CAAD Futures 2025学术委员会联合主席。其课题组成立于2024年，积极支持团队成员获得香港政府奖学金、优异论文奖等荣誉。
