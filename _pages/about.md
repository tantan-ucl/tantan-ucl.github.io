I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at University College London (UCL), under the supervision of [Prof Grant Mills](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/people/dr-grant-mills) and [Dr Eleni Papadonikolaki](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/people/dr-eleni-papadonikolaki). <br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and Master's degree in University College London (UCL). Before my PhD study, I worked at [iLab](https://fac.arch.hku.hk/iLab/people/), The University of Hong Kong as a Research Assistant, under the supervision of [Prof Weisheng Lu](https://www.arch.hku.hk/staff/faculty-office-staff/lu-wilson-w-s/) and [Dr Fan Xue](https://www.arch.hku.hk/staff/rec/xue-fan/?dept=rec).
